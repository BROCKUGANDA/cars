## Asset Optimization

Before adding images and videos to your project:

1. **Compress your images** using tools like:
   - [TinyPNG](https://tinypng.com/)
   - [Squoosh](https://squoosh.app/)
   - [ImageOptim](https://imageoptim.com/mac)

2. **Optimize videos** using:
   - [Handbrake](https://handbrake.fr/) - for compressing MP4 files
   - [FFmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org/) - for advanced video processing

3. **Use appropriate dimensions** - Don't upload 5000px wide images if they'll only display at 800px width.

4. **Consider WebP format** for better performance (with JPG fallbacks for older browsers).
